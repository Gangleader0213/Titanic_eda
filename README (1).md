# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To perform EDA on the Titanic dataset using summary statistics and data visualizations.

## ðŸ§ª Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset and checked info & missing values.
2. Calculated descriptive statistics (mean, std, etc.).
3. Created:
   - Histograms to understand data distribution.
   - Boxplots to analyze spread and outliers.
   - Pairplot to see feature interactions.
   - Correlation matrix & heatmap for feature relationships.

## ðŸ“Š Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Observations
- Younger passengers had slightly better survival chances.
- Females had higher survival rates.
- Pclass and Fare are correlated with survival.
- Some features are skewed or have outliers (especially Fare).
